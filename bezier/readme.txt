## Summary (of the Drawing):
The object drawn on the curve is a leaf. Once the savefile.txt is loaded,
a curve will be drawn with an autumn theme, and the animation will make it feel
as if the leaves are moving in a wave pattern.

## Primitives Used:
OpenGL: GL_POLYGON, GL_POINT, GL_LINE_STRIP

## Transformation Used
- glTranslatef
- glRotatef
- glScalef

## Methods Modified: 
- display() 
- keyboard()
- mouse()

## Coolest Things:
- Live editing of the control points (Drag with right mouse)
- Animation of object on the curve
- Shadow outline of the leaves

## Things to Note:
- The savefile.txt should be loaded with C1 turned on.
